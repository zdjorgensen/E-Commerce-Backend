  ## Description

  For challenge 13 `E-Commerce Backend` I took the starter code and managed to create a MySQL database that tracks products, categories, and tags. It took with awhile to figure out how to set up the routes to work properly but after the going through the second project while relied on routes, I was able to finish this challenge without too many more problems. I struggled with the many to many and many to one aspects as well but I also managed to get those working. I used previous Zoom recordings, my project 2 application, and previous class activities to help me with this challenge.

  When the user starts the application in the command line, they are able to use `Insomnia` to get, create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags. With this challenge to track which products belong to which category, and what tags go along with those products. The products tracks the name of the product, the price, how many are in stocks. The user can also update any of the values or delete any value from the database.
